Baked Noms was created for users to add their favorite bakeries and/or dessert shops, rate them, and search for other entries (the search bar was bonus feature that I added). For Baked Noms I installed new gems like devise, for creating user profiles, geocoder, to convert string addresses to coordinates, carrierwave and fog to help with uploading photos on AWS, and figaro to hide API keys in application.yml within .gitignore.
